    " The core of deep learning according to Andrew NG is that we now have fast enough computers and enough data to actually train large neural networks. He also commented on the important point that it is all about scale. That as we construct larger neural networks and train them with more and more data, their performance continues to increase. This is generally different to other machine learning techniques that reach a plateau in performance."
